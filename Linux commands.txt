(rw-): These permissions are for owner(root).

(r--): These permissions are for group(root).

(r--): These are for other users.

drwx------. 3 root root  17 Dec  4 16:59 systemd-private-5fd227d8a4ef48e6b5c6882e39a20c34-chronyd.service-BlH8yz

(d): d in the first field ,so it is a directory.

-rw-rw-r--. 1 devops devops   0 Dec  4 17:53 devops



How to change ownerships:

 chown (desired owner) (to which file/directory you would like to change).

How to change the group:

chgrp (desired group) (to which file/directory you would like to change).

let
read =4      CHMOD UGO=777
write=2
execute=1

eg:644= rw-r-r--
777=rwx-rwx-rwx-
755=rwx-rx-rx
